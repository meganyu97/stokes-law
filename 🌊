In the realm of words, a vast expanse appears,
Where knowledge and dreams converge, banishing fears.
But in this vast ocean, a crevasse so deep,
A tragic undertow of inequality causes hearts to weep.

A tale unfolds of a chasm wide,
Where dreams of young minds are cast aside.
Thirty million words, lost in the abyss,
A gulf of disparity, impossible to dismiss.

In this vast world, where words hold sway,
A gerontocratic gentility, leading the wealthy's way.
Across this expanse, a bridge firmly stands,
Reserved for wealth and privilege, guided by the invisible hand.
Picture this scene, let the image take hold,
A bridge of silver-spoon privilege, paved with gold.
Where WASP children tread, escorted with ease,
Underneath them, sinking silently, EBT-detainees. 

The bridge, a symbol of resources untold,
Nurturing young minds, fostering stories bold.
Words freely exchanged, knowledge expanding,
While others are left behind, their hopes disbanding.

Welfare-chained pedigree, their struggles profound,
Drowning in the depths, as they strive to be found.
‘Prestidigitation’, ‘bourgeoisie’,
Their worn-down blue collars fade into the menagerie.
They fight against currents, determined to reach,
Yet with odds stacked against them, their voices beseech.

But hold onto hope, for change is a choice,
To bridge the divide, let unity voice.
For it takes a village, together as one,
To equally empower every daughter and son.

Let us build bridges of support and care,
Reaching across oceans, our burdens to share.
Empower the voices that were once drowned,
Nurture the potential that has yet to be found.

Let us join hands and strive to create,
A world where no child is left to their fate.
Where every word spoken, every story told,
Bridges the gap, ensuring futures unfold.
